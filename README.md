# Vocabulary Assistant  

**An Android app for translating and memorizing vocabulary, developed using ChatGPT, Kivy, and Cursor.AI.**  

## Overview  

Vocabulary Assistant is an Android application designed to help users translate and remember vocabulary. It was developed by a software engineer with no prior app development background, leveraging AI-assisted coding tools such as ChatGPT and Cursor.AI.  

### Development Approach  

The app was primarily created using code generated by Cursor.AI, with the developer following suggestions from both ChatGPT and Cursor.AI for troubleshooting and environment setup. While AI tools provided most of the implementation, some knowledge of software development, Python, and debugging was necessary for understanding the code, setting up the environment, and troubleshooting issues.  

## Technologies Used  

- **[Kivy](https://kivy.org/):** Python framework for Android UI programming.  
- **[Pyjnius](https://github.com/kivy/pyjnius):** Enables access to Android APIs using Python.  
- **Android SpeechRecognizer API:** Used for speech recognition.  
- **Android TextToSpeech API:** Used for text-to-speech functionality.  
- **[Buildozer](https://github.com/kivy/buildozer) & ADB:** Used to build, deploy, and debug the Android package.  
- **SQLite3:** Stores lookup history.  
- **[OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/overview):** Used for translation and generating test questions.  

## Supported Languages  

The app currently supports the following languages:  

- English  
- Chinese  
- Korean  
- Japanese  
- French  
- German  
- Spanish
